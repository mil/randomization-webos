		<span class="desc">Are the typical numbers you generate from a random number generator actually random? Truthfully, they are not. They are what is known as psuedo-random. Psuedo-random numbers are generated using mathematical formulas to appear as if they are random numbers but actually not random.</span>
		<span class="desc">So Randomization offers you true random numbers based on <a href="http://www.random.org">Random.Org</a>'s service which generates random numbers from atmostpheric noise.</span>
		<span class="desc">For the time being this application requires an Internet connection. In future releases this application will allow you to switch between psuedo-random and true random numbers.</span>
