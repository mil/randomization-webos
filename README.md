Randomization App for WebOS
===========================
Whats the deal?
-----------
Randomization pulls from the [Random.Org API](http//random.org) to generate real random numbers. This is a WebOS native user-interface for accessing the Random.Org API. Done mainly in part to expose myself to the Mojo / WebOS Framework.

Inspiration
-----------
I wanted to be random. Oh so random. I was at a point where I was checking Random.ORG multiple times a day in my day to day life. From general gambling to just needing to be able to call out a number on the spot in games of dice, I needed randomness. So I created this. I wanted to take out my phone and be random in the spurr of the moment, but true random!
